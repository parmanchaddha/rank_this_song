# what it is: 
Rank this song is a project by Nathan Kredentser and Parmandeep Chaddha that aims to achieve the following:
    1. Create a basic web application that allows users to rank their favorite song by a band or an artist
    2. See what songs others are ranking the best
    3. Compare whether the songs that users are ranking the best are the same songs that are being played the 
        most. (The most played song statistics will be fetched from Spotify).
        
# frontend
The aim is to build a front end on react with beautiful UI/UX design to impress users, potential recruiters,
and of course, ourselves.

# backend
The backend is to built using python, and served using flask. Plotly dash will most likely be used to serve
graphs and other figures related to song data.

# code style
PEP 5 and ES6 code style should be followed for all python and react code respectively.
All code in this project will have appropriate documentation.
It is our hope that all code used in this project will also have appropriate testing.
