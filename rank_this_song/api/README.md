## The Backend

### Serving
The backend for this application is built using Python and served using Flask.

### Installing the Required Packages
Currently, there's no package manager controlling the python modules being used in this app.That's in the works.
Containerizing a new application takes time!

### Getting to Hello World? 
Have all the packages? Good.
Now you can try to see if everything will work correctly by opening up command prompt (or anaconda prompt) in this terminal and running the following command: <br>
` python -m pytest -v ` <br>
If all your tests are successful, we are almost at hello world. <br>

Now run from the same terminal: <br>
`python api.py` <br>
This will run and serve the Flask server (most probably on localhost:5000). <br>

Go to [link test] (https://localhost:5000) and you will have found the api. Yay!
